        <SectionText paragraph>
            Arthas met heavy resistance from the elves, rallied by Ranger-General Sylvanas
            Windrunner. Driving their forces before his undead army, he steadily pushed her people
            back in a swath of destruction towards Silvermoon, breaching the kingdom's two elfgates
            with ease. Sylvanas tried to warn the vast elven capital of the coming of the Scourge,
            but Arthas destroyed her camps and killed the Ranger-General. To make her pay for her
            perceived insolence towards him, Arthas corrupted her elven spirit, transforming it into
            a horrendous twisted form (a banshee) and enslaving her to the will of the Lich King,
            forcing her to slay her own people.

        <SectionText>
            Arthas and the marching armies of the Scourge annihilated Silvermoon, leaving it in
            ruins. On the road to the Sunwell, he fought Grand Magister Belo'vir and left him
            critically injured after severing his right arm. Arthas also faced Anasterian
            Sunstrider, the aged High King of Quel'Thalas, and killed him with minimal struggle.
            Arthas then used the Sunwell to bring Kel'Thuzad back as an undead lich.

        <SectionText paragraph>
            As the pair traveled to Alterac, Kel'Thuzad explained the full extent of the "second
            invasion" and the Lich King's plan. Arthas and Kel'Thuzad went to the Alterac Mountains
            to destroy encampments of Blackrock clan orcs who possessed a functional demon gate,
            which the lich would use to speak to the demon lord Archimonde. The Scourge destroyed
            the orcs to secure the portal for themselves. Archimonde instructed them to march to
            Dalaran and acquire the spellbook of Medivh so he could be summoned into Azeroth.

            Despite the Kirin Tor's valiant efforts to repel the invasion, the Scourge fought
            through their magical defenses and fortifications, killed the Archmage Antonidas and
            claimed the Book of Medivh.
        </SectionText>
        <SectionText>
            Arthas and his troops repelled the mages' vast counterattack as Kel'Thuzad began the
            lengthy summoning of the demon lord, reinforced by the Burning Legion's forces as the
            ritual progressed. Once Archimonde arrived, he proclaimed that the Lich King was of no
            further use to the Legion, and Tichondrius was placed in command of the Scourge. Arthas
            was left to wonder what would become of him and Kel'Thuzad, but the lich replied that
            all was going as the Lich King foresaw. The pair disappeared as Archimonde took his
            revenge on the city, destroying Dalaran with a single powerful ritual.

        <SectionTitle>Invasion of Kalimdor</SectionTitle>
        <SectionText paragraph>
            Arthas was next seen in Kalimdor on the Lich King's orders, joining the Legion's
            invasion not to aid them but to secretly undermine their efforts. From the shadows he
            influenced the Scourge, causing them to disobey their demon masters. This slowed the
            Legion's progress towards Hyjal Summit and sometimes even allowed the Legion's enemies
            to escape. When Arthas considered another way to more severely damage the Legion, he
            noticed Tichondrius and the Skull of Gul'dan which the dreadlord had used to create
            Felwood and corrupt the surrounding forests. The death knight was aware that he could
            not destroy Tichondrius directly without attracting Archimonde's attention. When he
            discovered Illidan Stormrage, Arthas realized that he could manipulate someone else to
            kill the dreadlord instead.

        <SectionText>
            Arthas sensed Illidan's yearning for power and approached him in Felwood. He told the
            recently freed demon hunter how to claim the skull's powers as his own, whereupon he
            could destroy Tichondrius. Illidan agreed to his plan, and Arthas disappeared again,
            awaiting to be teleported by Kel'Thuzad.

        <SectionText>
            Arthas remained on Kalimdor until after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, which resulted in the
            obliteration of the Legion forces. Following Archimonde's death, the allied forces
            launched a counterattack on the demonic remnants. Arthas only narrowly escaped the
            attack. He rallied as many of the Scourge as he could before retreating back home.

        <SectionTitle> Return to Lordaeron </SectionTitle>

        <SectionText paragraph>
            Archimonde left a trio of dreadlords behind in the ruined palace gardens of Lordaeron to
            ensure that the nation remained under control, and to watch over the cunning servitors
            of Ner'zhul. When the demon lord was defeated, however, they were not originally aware
            of it. This changed several months later, when Arthas returned to reclaim his throne. He
            threatened the dreadlords, who immediately fled, and then called Sylvanas and Kel'Thuzad
            to his side to stop a large group of human refugees, who were led by the paladins Halahk
            the Lifebringer, Magroth the Defender, and Dagren the Orcslayer as they tried to stall
            the Scourge so they could escape into the canyons, where the undead would have
            difficulty hunting them. However, during the climax of the battle, Arthas had a painful
            seizure, and felt the Lich King calling out to him. Despite his diminished powers,
            Arthas fought on until all the humans in the area were killed.

            Little did Arthas know that the Lich King's power had dwindled to the point that
            Sylvanas was no longer under his control. In secret, she attended a meeting with the
            three dreadlords, who told her that the Lich King's power was waning, and so the time
            had come to claim her vengeance.
        </SectionText>

        <SectionText>
            As Arthas returned to the capital city with Kel'Thuzad to discuss the threat, he was
            separated from Kel'Thuzad by the dreadlords, who attempted to kill him with several
            ghouls. Arthas killed the rogue undead and was forced to collect what loyalists he could
            find and fight his way through the dreadlords' forces, which included the powerful
            abomination Bloodfeast. As he arrived on the city's limits, he was saved by a cadre of
            banshees, who told him that Sylvanas had sent them to see him safely away. However, as
            they neared an empty spot in the forest, Arthas received another vision from the Lich
            King, who told him he'd been betrayed. Sylvanas then appeared and shot him with a
            paralyzing arrow, promising to torture him like he had done to her. Before she could
            start, Kel'Thuzad stepped in and chased her off with his forces.
        </SectionText>

        <SectionText>
            The Lich King's mental cries pierced Arthas' mind - he was told to return to Northrend,
            for demonic forces (later revealed to be Illidan and the naga) were working to destroy
            the Frozen Throne and end the self-proclaimed king's reign. Immediately, Arthas prepared
            his fleet and set sail for Northrend, leaving Kel'Thuzad behind to watch over Lordaeron.
