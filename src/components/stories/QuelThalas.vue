            Arthas met heavy resistance from the elves, rallied by Ranger-General Sylvanas
            Windrunner. Driving their forces before his undead army, he steadily pushed her people
            back in a swath of destruction towards Silvermoon, breaching the kingdom's two elfgates
            with ease. Sylvanas tried to warn the vast elven capital of the coming of the Scourge,
            but Arthas destroyed her camps and killed the Ranger-General. To make her pay for her
            perceived insolence towards him, Arthas corrupted her elven spirit, transforming it into
            a horrendous twisted form (a banshee) and enslaving her to the will of the Lich King,
            forcing her to slay her own people.

            Arthas and the marching armies of the Scourge annihilated Silvermoon, leaving it in
            ruins. On the road to the Sunwell, he fought Grand Magister Belo'vir and left him
            critically injured after severing his right arm. Arthas also faced Anasterian
            Sunstrider, the aged High King of Quel'Thalas, and killed him with minimal struggle.
            Arthas then used the Sunwell to bring Kel'Thuzad back as an undead lich.
